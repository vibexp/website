description: Sync the VibeXP documentation (docs/ in this repo, published at vibexp.io/docs) with the latest published releases of the VibeXP upstream products, core (vibexp/vibexp), CLI (vibexp/cli), design system (vibexp/design-system), and the generated API clients (vibexp/api-client-js, vibexp/api-client-go). Takes an optional scope argument, one or more of core, cli, design-system, api-client-js, api-client-go, or all (default all). Detects each release, audits the relevant doc pages against the release source with file:line evidence, fixes stale content, adds missing features, removes nonexistent ones, validates the site, opens a PR, and runs the automated review loop until approved. Use when asked to update the docs, sync docs with a release, or via /update-docs.

# Update Docs: sync documentation with the latest releases

Sync the documentation under `docs/` (published at
[vibexp.io/docs](https://vibexp.io/docs/)) with the **latest published release**
of one or more upstream products, end to end: detect the release, audit every in-scope
doc page against the release source with evidence, fix stale content, add
missing features, remove content that does not exist, validate the site, open
a PR, run the automated review loop until it approves, then stop and wait for
human review.

## Scope argument

The skill takes an optional argument: one or more scopes (space separated),
or `all`. No argument means `all`.

| Scope | Repository | Sibling checkout | Release marker | Docs surface | Guide |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `core` | [vibexp/vibexp](https://github.com/vibexp/vibexp) | `../vibexp` | `.vibexp-release` | the whole site except the surfaces below | user + developer |
| `cli` | [vibexp/cli](https://github.com/vibexp/cli) | `../cli` | `.vibexp-cli-release` | `user-guide/cli/` | user |
| `design-system` | [vibexp/design-system](https://github.com/vibexp/design-system) | `../design-system` | `.vibexp-design-system-release` | design-system content in `developer-guide/frontend/` | developer |
| `api-client-js` | [vibexp/api-client-js](https://github.com/vibexp/api-client-js) | `../api-client-js` | `.vibexp-api-client-js-release` | `developer-guide/api-clients/` (js) | developer |
| `api-client-go` | [vibexp/api-client-go](https://github.com/vibexp/api-client-go) | `../api-client-go` | `.vibexp-api-client-go-release` | `developer-guide/api-clients/` (go) | developer |

Audience placement:

- The **CLI** is how end users drive the platform from a terminal, so its
  docs live in the **user guide** (`user-guide/cli/`).
- The **design system** (`@vibexp/design-system` on npm) and the **generated
  API clients** (`@vibexp/api-client` on npm, `github.com/vibexp/api-client-go`
  Go module) are tools for application developers, so their docs live in the
  **developer guide** only.

With multiple scopes, run every phase for each product. Products that are
already in sync are skipped individually; one PR carries all changes.

## Hard rules

- **Docs track the latest published release, never `main`.** This applies to
  every repository. `main` may contain unreleased work that users cannot
  run. All validation happens against the release tag.
- **Every claim needs source evidence.** A doc statement survives only if the
  product source at its release tag proves it (file:line). Never document a
  feature you could not find in the source. Remove or fix claims the source
  contradicts.
- **Writing style**: no em dashes anywhere in documentation content, concise
  and to the point, readable and easily scannable (short paragraphs, clear
  headings, lists and tables over long prose).
- **Never merge the PR.** The flow ends with an approved, unmerged PR waiting
  for the human.

## Phase 0: Preconditions

1. Each in-scope product must exist at its sibling path (see the scope
   table; paths are relative to this repo's root, e.g.
   `$HOME/Projects/vibexp` when this repo is at `$HOME/Projects/website`).
   If missing:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vibexp/<repo>.git ../<repo>
   ```
2. `gh` must be authenticated (`gh auth status`). If not, stop and ask the
   user to authenticate.

## Phase 1: Determine versions

For each in-scope product:

1. Latest published release:
   ```bash
   gh release view --repo vibexp/<repo> --json tagName -q .tagName
   ```
   **Tag fallback:** some products (the API clients) publish no GitHub
   releases and version through git tags only (npm publish / Go module
   tags). When `gh release view` finds no release, use the highest semver
   tag instead:
   ```bash
   git -C ../<repo> fetch --tags --force
   git -C ../<repo> tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1
   ```
2. Last synced release: read the product's marker file at this repo's root
   (see the scope table). If the file is missing, infer the last synced
   version from git history (`git log --oneline`, look for the most recent
   docs-sync commit for that product) and treat the marker as needing
   creation. A missing marker with no prior sync commits (a first sync)
   means the whole docs surface for that product is new: audit against
   everything in the release.
3. **If every in-scope product's latest release equals its marker, report
   "docs are already in sync" with the versions and stop.** Do not create a
   branch or PR. If only some products are stale, continue with just those.

## Phase 2: Study what changed

For each stale product:

1. Check out the release tag in the product checkout:
   ```bash
   git -C ../<repo> fetch --tags --force && git -C ../<repo> checkout <tag>
   ```
2. Read the release notes for **every** release between the last synced
   version and the latest (`gh release view <tag> --repo vibexp/<repo>
   --json body -q .body` per tag). For tag-only products use the commit
   history between the tags (`git -C ../<repo> log <prev>..<latest>
   --oneline`) plus the changelog if one exists. For a first-time sync,
   read all releases.
3. Build a change inventory grouped by documentation impact: breaking
   changes, new features, changed behavior, removed features, infra changes
   (image, migrations, tooling versions, install methods, regenerated API
   surface).

## Phase 3: Worktree and parallel audit

Every docs path below is relative to `docs/` in this repo.

1. Create an isolated git worktree for the docs changes (EnterWorktree or
   `git worktree add`), branched from `origin/main`.
2. Fan out **parallel read-only audit agents** (Explore agents), each
   verifying one slice of the docs against the product source at its release
   tag. Suggested slices (adjust to where the release notes point):

   **Core** (`../vibexp` at the core tag):
   - **Config and deployment**: `developer-guide/backend/configuration.md`,
     `developer-guide/deployment/*`, `user-guide/self-hosting/*` vs the
     config structs, example YAMLs, Dockerfile, compose files, migrations.
   - **Agents**: `user-guide/ai-agents.md` vs the agents backend and frontend.
   - **User features and search**: `user-guide/memory.md`, `artifacts.md`,
     `prompts/*`, `mcp-server.md`, `blueprints.md`, `feeds.md`,
     `integrations/*`, `resource-access-analytics.md` vs search
     implementation, settings UI, MCP tool registration, REST routes.
   - **Developer guide backend**: `developer-guide/backend/*`,
     `developer-guide/getting-started.md`, `developer-guide/intro.md` vs
     migrations list, Makefile, dev stack, OpenAPI layout, generators.
   - **Frontend and general**: `developer-guide/frontend/*`,
     `developer-guide/contributing/*`, `user-guide/intro.md`,
     `quick-start.md`, `contributing.md`, `open-source/`, `docs/README.md` vs
     frontend structure, CI workflows, pre-commit hooks, toolchain versions.

   **CLI** (`../cli` at the cli tag):
   - **Install and updating**: install methods, upgrade paths, completions,
     man pages vs `README.md`, goreleaser config, `Makefile`, the update
     system in the source.
   - **Auth and configuration**: login flows, API keys, contexts, env vars,
     credential storage vs the auth and config packages under `internal/`.
   - **Commands**: every documented command, flag, exit code, and output
     format vs `cmd/` and the command implementations under `internal/`
     (and `docs/` in the cli repo for architecture claims).

   **Design system** (`../design-system` at its tag):
   - Documented tokens, components, utility classes, install/usage of
     `@vibexp/design-system` vs `tokens/`, `src/`, `docs/`, `README.md`,
     `CHANGELOG.md`.

   **API clients** (`../api-client-js`, `../api-client-go` at their tags):
   - Documented install, initialization, auth wiring, and API surface vs
     `README.md` and the generated code (`src/` for js,
     `client.gen.go`/`types.gen.go` for go), plus the bundled OpenAPI spec
     and the regeneration setup (`scripts/`, `Makefile`, codegen configs).
3. Each agent must return, per doc file: findings with (a) doc location,
   (b) doc claim, (c) actual source behavior with file:line evidence,
   (d) suggested correction, plus a list of missing topics.

## Phase 4: Update the documentation

Apply the aggregated findings in the worktree:

- **Fix** every claim the source contradicts (routes, config keys, versions,
  commands, flags, UI labels, statuses, limits).
- **Add** pages or sections for shipped features that have no docs, in the
  product's docs surface from the scope table. Pages are plain Markdown that
  must read well on GitHub: the H1 is the title (no frontmatter), and a
  directory's landing page is its `README.md`. **Register every new file in
  `docs.manifest.mjs`** (file, slug, label, group, description) or the build
  fails; the sidebar is generated from it. Link between docs with RELATIVE
  `.md` paths (`../memory.md#semantic-search`); `scripts/sync-docs.mjs` turns
  them into site routes. Starlight asides (`:::note`, `:::caution`) are fine.
- **Remove** documented features that do not exist in the source. Do not
  soften them; delete them.
- Follow the writing style rules. Do not introduce em dashes in any added or
  modified line.
- Keep `docs.manifest.mjs` in step: a renamed or deleted file must be
  renamed or removed there too, and a page whose opening is not a plain
  sentence needs a hand-written `description`.

## Phase 5: Validate

Run and require all green:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build        # also regenerates the docs from docs/
npm run check        # type check
npm run check:links  # every internal link and #fragment resolves
```

`check:links` is the one that catches a renamed heading or a moved page, so
it is not optional. It is also what `site-check.yml` runs on the PR.

## Phase 6: Markers, commit, push, PR

1. Write each synced product's latest release tag into its marker file (see
   the scope table). Only touch the markers of products actually synced in
   this run.
2. Keep the edits inside `docs/`, `docs.manifest.mjs` and the marker files.
   A docs sync that touches site code is a different change.
3. Commit with a `docs: sync documentation with <product> <version>` message
   (product names: `VibeXP`, `VibeXP CLI`, `VibeXP design system`,
   `VibeXP JS API client`, `VibeXP Go API client`). When several products
   changed, combine them in one message, summarizing the changes.
4. Push and open a PR against `main`. The PR body must state: the product(s)
   and version range(s) synced, the notable rewrites/additions/removals, and
   that every change was validated against the product source at its release
   tag.

## Phase 7: Automated review loop

1. Run the automated PR review (the `lab-workflow:review-pr` skill if
   available, otherwise `/code-review`) on the new PR.
2. Fix every `now` finding in the worktree, re-validate (Phase 5), push.
3. Re-run the review. Repeat until the verdict is APPROVE.

## Phase 8: Hand off

Report the PR URL, what changed, and the review verdict. **Stop.** The human
merges. Do not merge, even with admin rights, unless explicitly asked in a
later message.
