 * /robots.txt, and the one line that tells a crawler the sitemap exists.

 * @astrojs/sitemap emits /sitemap-index.xml and nothing points at it: the file
 * is otherwise reachable only by a crawler guessing the conventional name, or
 * by somebody submitting it in Search Console by hand.
 *
 * It is generated rather than dropped in public/ so the absolute `Sitemap:`
 * URL, which must be absolute per the sitemaps protocol, comes from SITE and
 * BASE in site.config.mjs. A static file would be the only place in this site
 * that spells the address out, and it would go stale in silence, since a wrong
 * Sitemap line is not an error anywhere. Crawlers just ignore it.
 *
 * This only does its job because the site sits at the root of its own domain.
 * A crawler reads robots.txt from the ORIGIN root, so under a path prefix it
 * would publish somewhere nothing looks for it. Keep that in mind before ever
 * moving the site under one.
