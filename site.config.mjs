/**
 * One definition of where this site lives.
 *
 * The site is published to GitHub Pages at its own domain, vibexp.io, so pages
 * sit at the ROOT and internal URLs carry no path prefix. Astro applies `base`
 * to its own routing and to Starlight's generated links, but NOT to hrefs
 * written by hand or written into markdown, so everything hand-written goes
 * through `url()` below rather than spelling any prefix out. Change the address
 * here and nothing else moves.
 *
 * BASE is the EMPTY STRING, not '/'. It is concatenated directly in a few
 * places that do not go through `url()`: `${BASE}/docs/` in
 * scripts/sync-docs.mjs, and `href.slice(BASE.length)` /
 * `href.startsWith(BASE + '/')` in scripts/check-links.mjs. With '/' those
 * become `//docs/`, an off-by-one slice, and a `'//'` prefix test that matches
 * nothing, so the docs links break and the link checker silently stops
 * checking. Astro wants '/' for the site root, and astro.config.mjs converts
 * it there.
 *
 * Unlike the sibling SlackCLI and Agento sites, this one does not live inside
 * the product's repository. The product is vibexp/vibexp; the website, the
 * documentation and the blog all live here, in vibexp/website. Two constants
 * follow from that and must not be confused: REPO is the product (what a
 * reader stars, downloads and files issues against), SITE_REPO is this
 * repository (what an "Edit page" link and a docs-relative link point at).
 *
 * The custom domain is written to public/CNAME. The sibling sites have none
 * because their Pages settings are managed in terraform; the vibexp GitHub
 * organisation is not, so the file is the source of truth here. If the org is
 * ever brought under terraform with a `github_repository_pages.cname`, delete
 * public/CNAME in the same change, or the two will disagree.

 *
 * Everything is denied except `security_storage`, and denied *globally* rather
 * than for the EEA alone. Consent Mode supports a `region` argument and this
 * deliberately does not use it: a site documenting a knowledge base people
 * run on their own servers, precisely so their data stays theirs, should not be measuring the visitors whose
 * regulator happens not to require asking. It also removes a whole class of

 * lands before anything fires. The replay below is what usually beats it -
 * reading localStorage is synchronous, so the update is pushed in the same
 * task as the default and the wait never elapses. The 500ms is the fallback
 * for the first visit, where the answer comes from a click.

/**
 * The banner itself: built in JavaScript rather than authored as markup, and
 * that is a constraint rather than a preference. Starlight builds its own
 * document and its only extension point is the head - which is why GTM's
 * <noscript> half is omitted (see gtmSnippet). A banner authored in
 * Page.astro would exist on the landing page and the blog and simply not on
 * the docs, which is the worst of the three outcomes. One head snippet reaches
 * both halves, and the banner needs JavaScript to do its job anyway.
 *
 * Four things here are requirements rather than choices:
 *
 * - **Accept and Reject are the same control.** Same size, same weight, same
 *   colour, adjacent. Regulators have repeatedly treated a prominent Accept
 *   beside a muted Reject as consent that was not freely given, and the design
 *   system has an accent that would make styling one of them "primary" the
 *   natural thing to do. Do not make Accept the primary button.
 * - **Refusing is one click**, same as accepting. There is no "manage
 *   preferences" step in between, because there is one purpose to consent to.
 * - **The choice is withdrawable.** `window.vibexpConsent.open()` reopens the
 *   banner and the footer link calls it, so changing your mind costs what
 *   giving consent cost.
 * - **It is inserted first in <body>**, not last. Fixed to the bottom visually,
 *   but early in the tab order - a keyboard visitor should not have to traverse
 *   the whole page to reach the thing blocking their consent decision.
 *
 * Dismissing without choosing is not offered: there is no X, and Escape does
 * not close it. An unanswered banner leaves the denied default in force, so
 * nothing is measured either way - but a dismiss control that silently means
 * "no" while looking like "later" is the pattern this is avoiding.
