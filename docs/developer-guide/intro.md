# Developer Guide

This guide is for people who want to **build VibeXP**, not just use it. It covers
how the codebase is organized, how to run it locally, the conventions that keep
the project consistent, and how to get a change merged.

If you are only running or self-hosting VibeXP, the
[User Guide](../user-guide/intro.md) and [Self-Hosting](../user-guide/self-hosting/README.md) pages
are the better starting point.

## What VibeXP is

VibeXP is an open-source, self-hostable AI command center: one shared knowledge
base for prompts, blueprints, memory, artifacts, feeds, and MCP integrations
that every AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and anything that speaks MCP)
can read from and write back to.

The project is open source under **AGPL-3.0-or-later** and lives in a single
public repository:

```text
https://github.com/vibexp/vibexp
```

## Monorepo layout

The repository is a **monorepo with two components that ship as one combined
container image**: `backend/Dockerfile` builds the frontend SPA and embeds it
into the Go binary (via the `embedfrontend` build tag), and each `vX.Y.Z`
GitHub Release publishes a single `ghcr.io/vibexp/vibexp` image.

```text
backend/   Go REST API (module github.com/vibexp/vibexp)
           cmd/         cobra commands
           internal/    server, services, repositories, auth, container (Wire DI)
           migrations/  SQL migrations
           openapi.yaml + paths/ + schemas/   API source of truth
           Dockerfile   builds the COMBINED image (embeds the SPA, embedfrontend tag)

frontend/  Vite + React + TypeScript SPA
           src/         pages, components, features, hooks, services, lib, utils

Makefile             all dev/CI tasks (backend-*, frontend-*)
docker-compose.yml   runs the PUBLISHED ghcr.io/vibexp/vibexp image + Postgres (self-host, NOT for dev)

```

:::note
Only `backend/` and `frontend/` live in this repository. The marketing site,
docs site, blog, CLI, and the `@vibexp/api-client` source each live in their own
repos under the [`vibexp` organization](https://github.com/vibexp).

## Tech stack

### Backend (`backend/`)

- **Go** REST API, module `github.com/vibexp/vibexp`. The toolchain is pinned to
  **Go 1.25.12** (`GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.25.12` in the `Makefile`) so local builds
  match CI exactly.
- **Spec-first OpenAPI.** `backend/openapi.yaml` — bundled from `paths/` and
  `schemas/` — is the single source of truth. The strict server bindings, Wire
  dependency-injection graph, and mocks are all **generated and committed**, then
  regenerated via `make` (never hand-edited).
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector** for storage and semantic search.
- **MCP endpoint** so AI tools connect over the Model Context Protocol.
- **Config-driven auth**: a provider registry (Google, GitHub, generic OIDC)
  configured in `config.yaml`, plus an embedded OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server
  for MCP tokens — with a dev-login bypass for local work.

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

- **Vite + React + TypeScript** single-page app. In production it is
  **embedded into the Go binary** and served by the backend from the same
  origin as the API — one image, one port.
- **Deployment-agnostic.** Built with a relative `VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api/v1`
  (same-origin, no proxy to configure) and configured at **runtime** via the
  backend-served `/config.js` (`window.__VIBEXP_ENV__`) — branding and
  analytics change with an env var and a restart, not a rebuild. The frontend
  never hardcodes a backend origin.

### Shared packages

The frontend consumes two npm packages that do **not** live in this repository:

- **`@vibexp/api-client`** — the typed API client generated from
  `backend/openapi.yaml` (source repo: `api-client-js`).
- **`@vibexp/design-system`** — the shared UI component library.

Both resolve from public npm; a fresh `npm install` needs no auth token.

## How a change flows through the codebase

A typical end-to-end change touches the spec first, then the generated client,
then the frontend:

1. Edit `backend/openapi.yaml` (via `paths/` + `schemas/`) and regenerate the
   server bindings.
2. Merge to `main`. Both generated clients (`@vibexp/api-client` on npm and
   the Go module `github.com/vibexp/api-client-go`) publish **automatically**
   with an auto-minor bump, dispatched by `publish-api-client.yml`. Never
   hand-publish or hand-tag a client for a spec change.
3. Bump the `@vibexp/api-client` dependency in the frontend and build against it.

See [Code Conventions](contributing/code-conventions.md) for the
details of this flow.

  and configured.
