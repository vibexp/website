# Getting Started

This page takes you from a fresh clone to a running backend and frontend, both
with hot reload. Local development is driven entirely by the root `Makefile`.

:::caution
The root `docker-compose.yml` runs the **published** `ghcr.io/vibexp/vibexp`
image for self-hosting — it is **not** the dev workflow. To develop VibeXP, use
the `make` targets below.
:::

## Prerequisites

- **Docker + Compose**: used to run PostgreSQL (with pgvector), Mailpit, and
  a local TEI embedding service. `docker-compose` or `podman-compose` both
  work.
- **Go 1.25.x**: the `Makefile` pins `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.25.12`, so Go downloads
  and uses that exact toolchain on demand even if your system Go is newer.
- **Node.js >= 22.22.0** for the frontend (its `engines` field requires `>=22.22.0`).
- **`pre-commit`** — required; commits are gated on it. Install with
  `pipx install pre-commit` or `brew install pre-commit`.
- **air** — for backend hot reload. Install with
  `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vibexp/vibexp.git
cd vibexp
```

## Install the pre-commit hooks

Do this once per clone, before your first commit. The hooks run the same checks
CI runs.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

:::danger
Never bypass the hooks (`--no-verify` / `-n` is forbidden). If a hook fails, fix
the cause. See [Pre-commit & CI](contributing/pre-commit-and-ci.md).
:::

## Run the backend

```bash
make backend-run-dev
```

This target:

- starts **PostgreSQL**, **Mailpit**, and a local **embeddings** service
  (HuggingFace TEI serving `mxbai-embed-large-v1`, 1024 dimensions) via
  Compose,
- starts the API under **air** for hot reload on any `.go` change.

The local email inbox (Mailpit) UI is at **http://localhost:8025**, the
embeddings service health check is at **http://localhost:8000/health**
(port configurable via `TEI_PORT`; the first start downloads the model,
roughly 670 MB), and the API serves on **http://localhost:8080** (health
check at `http://localhost:8080/health`).

:::note[Where `.env` and `config.yaml` come from]
On first run, `scripts/sync-env.sh` bootstraps **both** local files with dev
defaults — there is nothing to configure to start:

- **`backend/config.yaml`** (copied from `config.example.yaml`) — the
  **required, primary config surface**: all non-secret settings live here, and
  the backend fails fast at startup without it.
- **`backend/.env`** (copied from `.env.example`) — **secrets only**;
  `config.yaml` references each one as `${VAR}`, and the `make` targets load
  `.env` so those references resolve.

Only the `*.example` files are tracked in git; your `.env` and `config.yaml`
are gitignored.
:::

## Run the frontend

In a second terminal:

```bash
make frontend-run-dev
```

This copies `frontend/.env` from `.env.example` if missing, installs
dependencies if `node_modules` is absent, and starts the **Vite dev server at
http://localhost:5173**.

## Dev-login bypass (no identity provider needed locally)

You do **not** need an identity provider to develop locally. The dev defaults
enable a dev-login bypass (`auth.dev_login_enabled` in `config.yaml`, honored
only in local development), so you can sign in and click around immediately. A
real provider (Google, GitHub, or generic OIDC) is only required for real
deployments — see the self-hosting docs for production auth configuration.

## Common checks

Run these before committing (CI runs the same targets):

```bash
# Backend
make backend-test         # go test -race ./...
make backend-lint         # golangci-lint
make backend-check        # lint + vulncheck + security scan

# Frontend
make frontend-test        # vitest
make frontend-lint        # eslint
make frontend-type-check  # tsc
```
