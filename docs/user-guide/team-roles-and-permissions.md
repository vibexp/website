# Team roles & permissions

Every member of a team has exactly one **role**: **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**. The role decides what they may do in that team — who can invite people, manage projects, delete other people's work, or delete the team itself.

Roles are **per team**. You can be the Owner of one team and a Member of another; VibeXP works out your permissions separately for each.

## The three roles

| Role | Who it's for |
| --- | --- |
| **Owner** | The person who created the team. Exactly one per team. Can do everything, including deleting the team and handing ownership to someone else. |
| **Admin** | Trusted people who run the team day to day: invite and remove members, manage projects, moderate feeds. They cannot delete the team or transfer ownership. |
| **Member** | Contributors. They create and edit resources, but don't manage the team or its projects. |

### Which role should I give someone?

- **Owner** — leave it with whoever is accountable for the team. There is only ever one, and you change it by [transferring ownership](#transfer-ownership).
- **Admin** — for people you trust to manage others: onboarding new members, tidying projects, moderating feed posts.
- **Member** — the right default for everyone else. Members are not read-only: they can create prompts, memories, artifacts, blueprints and agents, and edit existing ones.

## What each role can do

| | Owner | Admin | Member |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Team** | | | |
| Change team name, slug, description | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Change team settings (search ranking, email provider, GitHub App) | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Delete the team | ✅ | — | — |
| Transfer ownership | ✅ | — | — |
| **Members** | | | |
| Invite new members | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Remove members | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Change a member's role | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| **Projects** | | | |
| Create a project | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Update any project | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Delete any project | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| **Resources** (prompts, memories, artifacts, blueprints, agents) | | | |
| Create | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Update *anyone's* | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete their own | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete *someone else's* | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| **Feeds** | | | |
| Post and reply | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete their own post | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete *someone else's* post (moderation) | ✅ | ✅ | — |

Everyone in a team can **view** the team, its members, its projects and all of its resources. Roles only govern what you can *change*.

Two entries surprise people, so they're worth stating plainly:

- **Members can update anyone's resources**, not just their own. VibeXP treats a team's prompts and memories as shared work. If that isn't what you want for a particular group of people, don't put them in the same team.
- **Members hold no project permissions at all.** Projects are containers that Admins and Owners curate; Members work inside them.

## Personal workspaces

Your **personal workspace** is a team like any other, with you as its Owner. Because it isn't shared, the team-management actions that need somebody else — inviting members and transferring ownership — aren't offered, and it cannot be deleted.

## Managing roles

Both actions live on **Teams → (your team)**, reachable from **Teams** in the sidebar.

### Change someone's role

Admins and Owners can switch any member between **Member** and **Admin** using the role dropdown in the members list.

The **Owner's row cannot be changed here** — ownership is not a role you assign, it's one you transfer. People with a pending invitation can't be changed either: they have no membership until they accept.

:::note[Share a pending invitation link]
Admins and Owners can copy a shareable accept link (`/invitations/accept/:token`) for a pending invitation from the members list, to hand it over directly if the invitation email never arrives.
:::

:::caution
You can demote **yourself** from Admin to Member. Nothing stops you, and you cannot undo it — you'd no longer hold the permission to change roles. Ask an Owner or another Admin to promote you back.
:::

### Transfer ownership

The Owner can hand the team to any member who has accepted their invitation, via **Transfer ownership**. It happens in one step:

- the person you choose becomes the **Owner**;
- you become an **Admin**.

You cannot undo this yourself — only the new Owner can transfer it back. There is always exactly one Owner.

## API keys and MCP agents

**An API key acts as the person who created it, with exactly their role.** A request authenticated with your API key can do precisely what you can do — no more, no less. The same applies to AI agents connected over the [MCP server](mcp-server.md): they act as the user who authorised them.

So:

- Give a key to an automation that only needs to create resources? Its owner being a **Member** is enough.
- If your key's owner is an **Admin**, anything holding that key can invite members and delete projects. Scope keys to the right person.
- **Demoting someone changes what their keys and agents can do, immediately.** There's no separate permission list to update.

## Permission names in the API

Team payloads from the API carry a `permissions` array listing exactly what *you* may do in that team, computed by the server from your role:

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "Engineering",
  "role": "admin",
  "permissions": [
    "team.update",
    "team.settings.update",
    "member.invite",
    "member.remove",
    "member.role.update",
    "project.create",
    "project.update",
    "project.delete",
    "resource.create",
    "resource.update.any",
    "resource.delete.own",
    "resource.delete.any",
    "feed.delete.any"
  ]
}
```

If you're building against the API, **read this array rather than deriving permissions from `role`** — the server owns the matrix, and reading it keeps you correct if it ever changes.

The complete set of permission strings:

| Permission | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `team.update` | Change team name, slug or description |
| `team.delete` | Delete the team |
| `team.transfer` | Transfer ownership to another member |
| `team.settings.update` | Change team-level settings such as search ranking |
| `member.invite` | Invite new members |
| `member.remove` | Remove members from the team |
| `member.role.update` | Change a member's role |
| `project.create` | Create a project in the team |
| `project.update` | Update any project in the team |
| `project.delete` | Delete any project in the team |
| `resource.create` | Create a prompt, memory, artifact, blueprint or agent |
| `resource.update.any` | Update any resource, including other members' |
| `resource.delete.own` | Delete a resource you created |
| `resource.delete.any` | Delete a resource created by someone else |
| `feed.delete.any` | Delete another member's feed post (moderation) |

These strings are stable API surface, defined by the `Team.permissions` schema in VibeXP's OpenAPI specification — that spec is the source of truth, and this table is kept identical to it.

## What happens if you try something you can't do

The interface hides actions your role doesn't allow, so mostly you won't meet a wall. If you do — say your role changed while you had the page open — the request is refused by the server and VibeXP tells you that you don't have permission. **The server enforces every one of these rules**; hiding buttons is a convenience, not the boundary.
