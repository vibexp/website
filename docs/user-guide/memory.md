# Memory

Your personal AI knowledge vault that remembers everything important about your projects, preferences, and workflows. Never explain the same thing twice.

## Overview

Memory Management is an intelligent context persistence system that stores, organizes, and retrieves important information across all your AI interactions. Think of it as your AI's long-term memory.

### Key Benefits

- **Never Repeat Yourself**: Store context once, use everywhere
- **Instant Recall**: Find any memory in milliseconds
- **Auto-Context**: AI automatically references relevant memories
- **Rich Metadata**: Labels, categories, and custom fields
- **Cross-Platform**: Web, API, and MCP access

## What Are Memories?

Memories are text-based information snippets that provide context to AI conversations:

- Project specifications
- Coding standards and conventions
- Personal preferences and style guides
- Workflow procedures
- Important facts and decisions
- Team guidelines
- Technical constraints

## Creating Memories

### Manual Creation

1. Navigate to **Memory** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create New Memory**
3. Enter memory details:
   - **Text**: The memory content
   - **Project**: Organization grouping (optional)
   - **Labels**: Free-form words to group and filter by (up to 10)
   - **Metadata**: Category, priority, custom fields
4. Click **Save**

### Example Memory

```
Project: vibexp-backend
Category: coding-standards
Priority: high

TypeScript Style Guide:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer const over let
- Use async/await over promises
- Follow Airbnb ESLint rules
- Document complex functions with JSDoc
```

### Automatic Creation via MCP

Connected AI tools can create memories during conversations:

```typescript
vibexp_io_create_memory({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  project_id: "<project-uuid>",
  text: "User prefers React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS",
  metadata: {
    category: "coding_preferences",
    priority: "medium"
  }
})
```

## Organizing Memories

### Project Grouping

Organize memories by project:

```
user/preferences
company/main-app
personal/workflows
client/project-x
```

### Metadata Organization

#### Categories

Organize by category:
- `coding_standards`
- `project_specs`
- `workflow_procedures`
- `personal_preferences`
- `team_guidelines`

#### Priorities

Set importance levels:
- `high`: Critical context always referenced
- `medium`: Important but context-dependent
- `low`: Nice-to-have background information

#### Labels

Group memories with labels, up to 10 per memory:
- Technology: `typescript`, `react`, `nodejs`
- Domain: `frontend`, `backend`, `devops`
- Purpose: `style-guide`, `architecture`, `deployment`

Labels used to be kept as tags in `metadata.tags`; since v0.13.0 they are a
field of their own, shared with prompts, artifacts and blueprints. See
[Labels](labels.md).

### Linking Memories to What They Explain

Labels group memories; relations connect them to specific resources. A memory that
records why a decision was made can be attached to that resource, which is then
`explained-by` the memory, so the reasoning surfaces next to the thing it
justifies rather than only in search. See [Relations](relations.md).

## Memory Lifecycle Status

Every memory has a lifecycle **status** that controls where it appears:

- **active** — the default. Active memories show up in memory lists and in search results.
- **draft** — a work in progress. Drafts appear in default memory lists so you can keep refining them, but they are **never returned by search**, so AI tools won't pick them up as context.
- **archived** — retired. Archived memories are hidden from default lists and from search, but remain reachable when you filter the list by the `archived` status explicitly.

### Changing a Memory's Status

- **In the app** — the memory create/edit form includes a status selector, each memory shows a status badge in the list and detail views, and the memory list has a status filter (including "All statuses") so you can find drafts and archived memories.
- **Over MCP** — `vibexp_io_create_memory` and `vibexp_io_update_memory` both accept a `status` parameter (`active`, `draft`, or `archived`), so connected AI tools can, for example, park an unconfirmed fact as a draft or archive an outdated one.

:::tip
Prefer archiving over deleting: an archived memory stops influencing search and AI context but stays available if you need it back.

## Searching and Filtering

### Semantic Search

Search finds memories **by meaning**, not just by matching words:

```
Search: "React hooks best practices"
```

Surfaces memories about React hooks and best practices even when they use different wording. Semantic search is the default.

:::note[Keyword fallback]
Semantic search requires the deployment to have an embedding provider configured. When it doesn't, VibeXP automatically falls back to keyword full-text search — same search box, exact-word matching instead of matching by meaning.
:::

#### Keyword search syntax

In keyword mode (no embedding provider) the search box supports these operators:

- `"exact phrase"`: words in quotes must appear together, in order.
- `word1 OR word2`: match either term (plain words are ANDed by default).
- `term -excluded`: exclude results containing a term.

Title matches rank highest, and ranking is length-normalized so a short,
on-topic title beats a long document that merely mentions the term. A single
mistyped word still matches by typo tolerance.

In **semantic mode** (embedding provider configured) the query is embedded as
text, so these operators are treated as ordinary words rather than search
operators.

### Advanced Filters

Filter memories by:
- **Labels**: Over the REST API, `?labels=` returns memories carrying any of
  the listed labels (see [Labels](labels.md#filtering-by-label))
- **Status**: Memory lifecycle status
- **Metadata**: The metadata filter matches on any metadata key-value pairs.
  Pick a key, then one or more values (with typeahead from the values your
  team actually uses). Keys combine with AND, values within a key with OR,
  and all of it is applied server-side
- **Project**: Use the global project selector in the app header to scope the
  list to one project (or all)

Fields like category and priority live in each memory's free-form metadata
and are searchable.

The memory create and edit form includes a key-value metadata editor for adding or changing metadata pairs directly in the UI.

To query memories by the metadata they carry, see [Metadata filtering](metadata-filtering.md).

## Auto-Context Injection

### How It Works

When using AI tools connected via MCP:

1. You start a conversation
2. AI analyzes the context and topic
3. Relevant memories are automatically searched
4. Matching memories are injected as context
5. AI uses this context in responses

### Relevance Matching

Memories are ranked by **semantic relevance** to the query (vector
similarity). When recency ranking is enabled, relevance is blended with how
recently a memory was created or updated. Ranking is configurable **per
team** on the team's Search Settings page (presets or advanced tuning of the
relevance/created/updated weights and half-life), falling back to the
instance defaults. Without an embedding provider, matching falls back to
keyword (full-text) search with typo tolerance.

### Manual Reference

You can also manually reference memories:

```
"Using the coding standards from memory..."
"Apply the deployment procedure we discussed..."
```

Connected AI tools can search and retrieve specific memories on demand.

## Updating Memories

### Edit Existing

1. Find the memory
2. Click **Edit**
3. Update text or metadata
4. Save changes

### Version History

Every save snapshots the memory's content as a **version**. The memory view
keeps the full version history: browse earlier snapshots, diff them against
the current text, and restore an older version when a change went wrong.
The instance keeps the 20 most recent versions per memory by default
(`retention.content_version_limit`).

## MCP Integration

### Creating Memories

```javascript
// AI tools create memories during conversations
vibexp_io_create_memory({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  project_id: "<project-uuid>",
  text: "User's testing framework preference: Jest with React Testing Library",
  status: "active", // optional: active (default), draft, or archived
  labels: ["jest", "react", "testing"],
  metadata: {
    category: "testing",
    priority: "medium"
  }
})
```

### Listing Memories

```javascript
// AI tools list memories for context with the generic list_resources tool
vibexp_io_list_resources({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  resource_type: "memory",
  project_id: "<project-uuid>",
  search: "database",
  limit: 5
})
```

### Retrieving Specific Memory

```javascript
// Get a memory's full content by ID with the generic get_resource tool
vibexp_io_get_resource({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  resource_type: "memory",
  id: "<memory-uuid>"
})
```

### Updating Memories

```javascript
// Update memory content, status, or metadata
vibexp_io_update_memory({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  memory_id: "<memory-uuid>",
  text: "Updated content...",
  status: "archived", // optional lifecycle change
  metadata: {
    priority: "high"
  }
})
```

### Deleting Memories

AI tools delete a memory with the generic `vibexp_io_delete_resource` tool, passing `resource_type: "memory"` and the memory's `id`:

```javascript
vibexp_io_delete_resource({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  resource_type: "memory",
  id: "<memory-uuid>"
})
```

Deletion also removes the memory's search embeddings. Prefer archiving (`status: "archived"`) when you might want the memory back.

## API Access

### REST API Endpoints

All memory endpoints are team-scoped:

```bash
# List memories (optional filters: project_id, search, status, ...)
GET /api/v1/{team_id}/memories?project_id={project_id}

# Get specific memory
GET /api/v1/{team_id}/memories/{memory_id}

# Create memory
POST /api/v1/{team_id}/memories

# Update memory
PUT /api/v1/{team_id}/memories/{memory_id}

# Delete memory
DELETE /api/v1/{team_id}/memories/{memory_id}
```

See [API Keys](integrations/api-keys.md) for authentication.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many memories can I store?

Unlimited. Create as many memories as needed for your context library.

### How does auto-context work?

When AI tools are connected via MCP, they automatically search your memories for relevant context based on conversation topics and keywords.

### Can I control which memories are used?

Yes. Use priority levels and project grouping to control which memories are most likely to be referenced.

### Are memories shared between projects?

Memories can be project-specific or global. Project-specific memories are only referenced in that project context.

### Can I export memories?

There is no built-in export button. Use the REST API
(`GET /api/v1/{team_id}/memories`) to list your memories as JSON, or connected
AI tools via MCP to retrieve them.

### How secure are my memories?

All memories are encrypted at rest and in transit. Access is controlled via API keys with user-specific isolation.
