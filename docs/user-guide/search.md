# Search Settings

VibeXP's search blends two things: **how well a resource matches your query** (relevance) and **how recently it was created or updated** (freshness). How those two are weighed is a **per-team setting**, so a fast-moving team can favour fresh context while another keeps strict relevance ordering, in the same deployment.

## Where the setting lives

Open your team, then **Settings → Search** (URL `/teams/<team>/settings/search`).

Who may change it:

| Role | Can do |
| --- | --- |
| **Owner**, **Admin** | Change the ranking profile and reset it to the instance defaults |
| **Member** | View the effective settings, read-only |

This is the `team.settings.update` permission; see [Team roles and permissions](team-roles-and-permissions.md). The server enforces it on every write; a read-only view is a convenience, not the boundary.

## The three presets

Most teams should pick a preset and move on. A preset is just a shorthand for the underlying numbers; there is no hidden "preset" state, so a profile stays readable and editable either way.

| Preset | Recency ranking | Relevance | Created | Updated | Half-life |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Relevance only** | off | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| **Balanced** | on | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 90 days |
| **Favor recent** | on | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 30 days |

- **Relevance only**: order purely by how well a resource matches the query. Age is ignored. This *is* "recency ranking off", which is why there is no separate on/off switch.
- **Balanced**: mostly relevance, with a nudge toward fresher resources. A good default for most teams.
- **Favor recent**: weight freshness heavily and decay it faster. Suits fast-moving workspaces where stale context misleads more than it helps.

If your values match none of the three, the page shows **Custom**. That is a normal state, not an error: it is what you get after tuning anything in **Advanced**.

## Advanced: the raw numbers

The **Advanced** section exposes the four values the presets write:

| Value | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `rank_weight_relevance` | Weight of semantic/keyword relevance. Normally the dominant one. |
| `rank_weight_created` | Weight of how recently the resource was created. |
| `rank_weight_updated` | Weight of how recently the resource was updated. |
| `rank_half_life_days` | Freshness decay half-life. A resource exactly this old scores half its freshness. |

Two things worth knowing before you tune:

- **The three weights are normalized by their sum**, so only their *ratio* matters. `0.5 / 0.3 / 0.2` and `5 / 3 / 2` behave identically; they need not add up to 1.
- **Freshness decays exponentially.** With a 90-day half-life, something 90 days old scores 0.5 on freshness, 180 days old scores 0.25, and so on. Shorter half-life = a sharper preference for new work.

Weights must be non-negative and not all zero, and the half-life must be greater than 0 and at most 36500 days.

## Inheriting the instance defaults

A team either has **its own complete profile** or **none at all**; there is no per-field blend.

- **No override**: the team inherits the deployment's defaults, and the page shows a **Using instance defaults** badge. If an operator changes those defaults, the team follows along.
- **Its own profile**: the team's saved values apply, and operator changes to the defaults no longer affect it.

**Reset to defaults** drops the team's profile so it inherits again. Note that it returns you to whatever the instance default *is at that moment*, not to whatever it was when you first overrode it.

## Pagination is capped while recency ranking is on

This one surprises people, so it is worth stating plainly.

When recency ranking is enabled, VibeXP pulls the top matches by relevance and **re-ranks that pool in memory**. The pool size is the instance's **candidate cap** (200 by default). Results outside it are never re-ranked and are **not reachable by paging further**, so the reported result count is clamped to the size of that pool. If your query matches more than the cap, you will see exactly the cap's worth of results and no more.

With recency ranking **off**, none of this applies: pagination runs against the full result set as usual.

The Search Settings page shows your deployment's actual cap in the Advanced section. If you need to page deeper than that, either narrow the query or ask your operator to raise the cap.

**The candidate cap is not team-configurable.** It is the one search knob that stays instance-only, because raising it increases memory and latency for *every* query on the deployment; one team must not be able to spend the whole instance's budget. Operators: see [Backend configuration](../developer-guide/backend/configuration.md).

## It applies to your AI tools too

A team's ranking profile is **not** a web-app preference. The web app, the [MCP server](mcp-server.md), and the CLI all go through one search entry point, so the profile applies identically to every MCP-connected agent searching that team's workspace.

That is usually what you want: an agent asking "what do we know about X" gets the same ordering a teammate would. But it means changing the profile changes what your autonomous agents retrieve, not just what you see on screen.
