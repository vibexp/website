# Managing Prompts

Learn how to view, search, filter, edit, and delete prompts in your library.

## Viewing Your Prompts

Navigate to **Prompts** → **My Prompts** from the left sidebar to see your prompt library.

The prompts list displays:
- **Name**: Prompt title with icons indicating special features (MCP-enabled, references, etc.)
- **Description**: Brief summary of the prompt's purpose
- **Status**: Draft (yellow badge) or Published (green badge)
- **Updated**: Last modification date
- **Actions**: View, Edit, and Delete buttons

## Searching Prompts

Use the search bar at the top of the Prompt Management page to find prompts quickly.

**Search by:**
- Prompt name
- Description text
- Prompt content

Simply type your search term and the list updates instantly to show matching prompts.

**Example searches:**
- "blog" - finds all blog-related prompts
- "customer" - finds customer support and customer-facing prompts
- "email" - finds all email template prompts

## Filtering Prompts

Use the filter dropdowns to narrow down your prompt list:

### Filter by Status

Click the **All Status** dropdown to filter by:
- **All Status**: Show all prompts regardless of status
- **Draft**: Show only work-in-progress prompts
- **Published**: Show only finalized prompts

Use this to focus on prompts that need finishing or to view only production-ready templates.

### Filter by Type

Click the **All Prompts** dropdown to filter by prompt type or special characteristics.

### Filter by Labels

Click the **All Labels** dropdown to filter by assigned labels.

If you've organized your prompts with labels like `marketing`, `engineering`, or `email`, you can quickly view all prompts with a specific label.

### Advanced Filtering

Click the filter icon on the far right to access additional filtering options.

## Sorting Prompts

Click any column header to sort the prompt list:

- **Name**: Alphabetical order (A-Z or Z-A)
- **Status**: Group by Draft or Published
- **Updated**: Most recent or oldest first

The currently sorted column displays an arrow indicator showing the sort direction.

## Editing Prompts

To modify an existing prompt:

1. Locate the prompt in your list (use search/filter if needed)
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) in the Actions column
3. Make changes to:
   - Title
   - Content
   - Description
   - Labels
   - Status
   - MCP availability
   - Slug
4. Click **Save as Draft** or change status to **Published** and save

The prompt editor is identical to the creation interface, so all the same features are available.

## Deleting Prompts

To permanently remove a prompt:

1. Locate the prompt in your list
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) in the Actions column
3. Confirm deletion in the dialog that appears

**Warning:** Deleted prompts cannot be recovered. If other prompts reference the deleted prompt using the `@` syntax, those references will fail to resolve.

### Before Deleting

Check if the prompt is:
- Referenced by other prompts (use search to find references like `@prompt-slug`)
- Being used in active workflows
- Enabled for MCP access by external tools

Consider changing the status to Draft instead of deleting if you might need the prompt later.

## Viewing Prompt Details

To view a prompt without editing:

1. Click the **View** button (eye icon) in the Actions column
2. Review the prompt content and settings in read-only mode
3. Click **Back to Prompts** or use your browser's back button to return to the list

This is useful for:
- Quickly checking prompt content
- Copying prompt text to use elsewhere
- Verifying settings without risk of accidental changes

## Bulk Operations

While individual prompt management is straightforward, you can work more efficiently with multiple prompts:

**Checkbox Selection**
Click the checkbox at the start of each row to select multiple prompts. This prepares prompts for bulk operations (feature availability may vary).

## Organizing Your Library

### Using Labels Effectively

Create a labeling system that matches your workflow:

**By Domain**
- `marketing`, `engineering`, `support`, `sales`

**By Format**
- `email`, `blog`, `social-media`, `documentation`

**By Complexity**
- `beginner`, `advanced`, `template`

**By Project**
- `project-alpha`, `client-xyz`, `internal`

**Example organization:**
A blog writing prompt might have labels: `marketing`, `blog`, `template`

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive titles that indicate:
- **Purpose**: What the prompt does
- **Domain**: What area it applies to
- **Format**: What type of output it generates

**Good Examples:**
- "Blog Post Outline - Tech Industry"
- "Code Review - Security Focus"
- "Email Template - Customer Onboarding"

**Poor Examples:**
- "Prompt 1"
- "Test"
- "asdfasdf"

### Draft vs Published Workflow

**Use Drafts For:**
- Experimenting with new prompt ideas
- Testing different phrasings
- Collecting work-in-progress templates
- Collaborating on prompt development

**Use Published For:**
- Production-ready templates
- Shared team resources
- MCP-accessible prompts
- Client-facing templates

**Best Practice:** Create new versions as drafts while keeping the published version stable. Test thoroughly before promoting drafts to published.

## Maintaining Your Library

Regular maintenance keeps your prompt library useful and organized:

**Regular Cleanup** (monthly or quarterly)
- Archive or delete unused prompts
- Update outdated instructions
- Consolidate similar prompts
- Remove test prompts

**Version Documentation**
- Update descriptions when making significant changes
- Note breaking changes in the prompt content itself
- Consider creating a new prompt for major revisions rather than editing the original

**Quality Checks**
- Test prompts periodically to ensure they still produce desired results
- Update prompts as AI models evolve
- Refine variable names and instructions based on usage experience

## Load Template Feature

When creating or editing a prompt, use the **Load Template** button to:
- Import content from an existing prompt
- Start with a pre-built template structure
- Quickly duplicate and modify existing prompts

This speeds up prompt creation by building on proven templates.
