# Artifacts

Transform your AI conversations into a searchable knowledge base. Capture, organize, and retrieve code snippets, documentation, and reports with powerful search and categorization.

## Overview

Artifacts Management automatically preserves substantial AI-generated content from your conversations, turning scattered outputs into an organized, searchable library. Never lose valuable code snippets or documentation again.

### Key Benefits

- **Never Lose Content**: Auto-capture AI outputs forever
- **Instant Search**: Full-text search across all artifacts
- **Smart Organization**: Categorize by project, type, and status
- **MCP Integration**: AI tools create and access artifacts automatically
- **Beautiful Previews**: Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting

## What Are Artifacts?

Artifacts are substantial pieces of AI-generated content:

- Code snippets and functions
- Documentation and guides
- Data structures and schemas
- Meeting summaries
- Analysis reports
- Technical specifications

## Creating Artifacts

### Manual Creation

1. Navigate to **Artifacts** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create New Artifact**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Project**: Organizational grouping (e.g., "my-app/backend")
   - **Slug**: Unique identifier (auto-generated from title)
   - **Title**: Descriptive name
   - **Description**: Brief summary (optional)
   - **Type**: any of your team's artifact types (default: general)
   - **Content**: Your artifact content (supports Markdown)
   - **Status**: active or expired
4. Click **Save**

### Automatic Creation via MCP

When AI tools are connected via MCP, they can automatically create artifacts during conversations:

```typescript
// AI tools can create artifacts automatically
vibexp_io_create_artifact({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  project_id: "<project-uuid>",
  slug: "api-documentation-v1",
  title: "REST API Documentation",
  content: "# API Endpoints\n\n## Users\n...",
  type: "static-contexts",
  status: "active"
})
```

## Organizing Artifacts

### Project Structure

Organize artifacts using project naming:

```
user/project-name
organization/repository
category/subcategory
```

Examples:
- `shaharia/vibexp-backend`
- `personal/code-snippets`
- `work/documentation`

### Artifact Types

Artifact types are **custom categories your team defines** under Settings →
Customization → **Artifact Types**. Every team starts with the default
`general` type; add types that match how your team works, for example:

- **work-reports**: completed analyses, status reports, summaries
- **static-contexts**: documentation, code snippets, reference material
- **general**: meeting notes, brainstorming, miscellaneous content

When creating an artifact (in the UI or via MCP), the type value must match
one of your team's configured types.

### Status Management

- **active**: Currently relevant artifacts
- **expired**: Archived or outdated content

Change status anytime without deleting artifacts.

### Linking to other resources

Beyond projects and status, artifacts can be linked to the resources they came
from. A new version of a document `supersedes` the one it replaces, and an
artifact is `built-from` the prompt that produced it, so the chain from
instruction to output stays visible. See [Relations](relations.md).

## Searching and Filtering

### Full-Text Search

Search across titles, descriptions, and content:

```
Search: "authentication implementation"
```

Finds all artifacts mentioning authentication and implementation.

### Advanced Filters

Filter by:
- **Project**: Show artifacts from specific projects
- **Type**: any of your team's artifact types
- **Status**: active or expired
- **Creation Date**: Date range filtering
- **Metadata**: Match on any metadata key-value pairs. Pick a key, then one
  or more values (with typeahead from the values your team actually uses).
  Keys combine with AND, values within a key with OR
- **Labels**: Over the REST API, `?labels=` returns artifacts carrying any of
  the listed labels (see [Labels](labels.md#filtering-by-label))

### Sort Options

- **Newest First**: Recently created artifacts
- **Oldest First**: Historical artifacts
- **Alphabetical**: By title or slug
- **Most Relevant**: Based on search query

## Working with Artifacts

### Preview and View

- **List View**: Quick overview with metadata
- **Detail View**: Full content with formatting
- **Markdown Rendering**: Beautiful syntax highlighting
- **Code Blocks**: Language-specific formatting

### Update and Version

1. Open an artifact
2. Click **Edit**
3. Make your changes
4. Save to update

Artifacts keep a **content-version history**. Each time you save a change, the previous content is snapshotted as a numbered version, so you can:

- **View version history** — browse the list of past versions, newest first.
- **Inspect a version** — open any earlier snapshot to see its content.
- **Diff** — compare a previous version against the current content.
- **Restore** — roll the artifact back to an earlier version. Restoring snapshots the pre-restore content as a new version first, so you can move forward or back between recent snapshots.

:::note[Version retention limit]
Version history is bounded by an operator-configurable retention limit (**20 versions per artifact by default**). When the limit is reached, the oldest versions are pruned as new ones are created. Your instance's operator can raise the limit or disable pruning entirely — but on a default deployment, don't rely on very old versions staying available forever.
:::

### Metadata

Add custom metadata for enhanced organization:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "language": "typescript",
  "framework": "react",
  "author": "team-frontend"
}
```

Access metadata in search and filtering.

**Editing metadata:** the create and edit form includes a key-value metadata editor for adding or changing metadata pairs directly in the UI.

**Filtering by metadata:** see [Metadata filtering](metadata-filtering.md) for querying artifacts by the metadata they carry, in the UI, the API, and over MCP.

## Bulk Operations

### Batch Delete

1. Select multiple artifacts
2. Click **Bulk Actions** → **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

### Batch Status Update

1. Select artifacts
2. Click **Bulk Actions** → **Update Status**
3. Choose new status (active/expired)

## MCP Integration

### Creating Artifacts

Connected AI tools can create artifacts:

```javascript
// Example: AI creates artifact during conversation
vibexp_io_create_artifact({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  project_id: "<project-uuid>",
  slug: "error-handler",
  title: "Error Handler Implementation",
  content: "```typescript\n...\n```",
  type: "static-contexts"
})
```

### Listing Artifacts

AI tools list and filter your artifacts with the generic `vibexp_io_list_resources` tool, passing `resource_type: "artifact"`:

```javascript
// List artifacts in a project, filtered by a search term
vibexp_io_list_resources({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  resource_type: "artifact",
  project_id: "<project-uuid>",
  search: "authentication",
  limit: 10
})
```

### Retrieving Artifacts

Get a specific artifact's full content with `vibexp_io_get_resource` (`resource_type: "artifact"`), by project and slug:

```javascript
// Retrieve by project and slug
vibexp_io_get_resource({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  resource_type: "artifact",
  project_id: "<project-uuid>",
  slug: "error-handler"
})
```

### Deleting Artifacts

AI tools delete an artifact with the generic `vibexp_io_delete_resource` tool, passing `resource_type: "artifact"` with the artifact's `project_id` and `slug`:

```javascript
vibexp_io_delete_resource({
  team_id: "<team-uuid-or-slug>",
  resource_type: "artifact",
  project_id: "<project-uuid>",
  slug: "error-handler"
})
```

Deleting an artifact also removes its search embeddings and its attachments.

## Common Use Cases

### Code Snippet Library

```

### Project Documentation

Maintain living documentation:

```
Project: company/main-app
Type: static-contexts
Examples:
- "architecture-overview"
- "deployment-guide"
- "api-reference"
```

### Work Reports

Track completed work:

```
Project: client/project-x
Type: work_reports
Examples:
- "sprint-15-summary"
- "performance-analysis"
- "security-audit-report"
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- Use consistent slug patterns
- Include version numbers for evolving content
- Use descriptive, searchable titles

### Project Organization

- Group related artifacts by project
- Use hierarchical project names
- Keep project names short but clear

### Content Guidelines

- Use Markdown for formatting
- Include context in descriptions
- Tag with relevant metadata
- Regular cleanup of expired artifacts

### Search Optimization

- Use descriptive titles and descriptions
- Include keywords in content
- Add searchable metadata tags
- Keep content focused and specific

## API Access

### REST API Endpoints

All artifact routes are team-scoped and project-addressed:

```bash
# List artifacts in a team
GET /api/v1/{team_id}/artifacts

# List artifacts in a project
GET /api/v1/{team_id}/artifacts/{project_id}

# Get a specific artifact
GET /api/v1/{team_id}/artifacts/{project_id}/{slug}

# Create artifact
POST /api/v1/{team_id}/artifacts

# Update artifact
PUT /api/v1/{team_id}/artifacts/{project_id}/{slug}

# Delete artifact
DELETE /api/v1/{team_id}/artifacts/{project_id}/{slug}
```

See [API Keys](integrations/api-keys.md) for authentication.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many artifacts can I store?

Unlimited. Store as many artifacts as needed to build your knowledge base.

### Can I export artifacts?

Yes. Export individual artifacts or entire projects in JSON or Markdown format.

### Do artifacts have size limits?

Individual artifacts should be under 1MB. For larger content, consider splitting into multiple artifacts.

### Can I share artifacts?

Artifacts are scoped to a **team**. Everyone in the team can access the team's artifacts, so inviting collaborators to your team is how you share.

### How long are artifacts stored?

Artifacts are stored indefinitely until you delete them. Use status "expired" to archive without deleting.
